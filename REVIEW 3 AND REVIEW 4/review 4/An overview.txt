1. Session Management
Areas for Improvement
Ensure session invalidation when the user logs out to avoid unintended access:

2. Error Handling
Add meaningful error handling for:
Missing or invalid input fields.
Backend issues (e.g., database connection failure).

3. Backend Integration
Currently, user data is managed via session. Replace this with a database integration using JDBC:
Store user details in a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Fetch user data dynamically for profile display.

4. Security
Add input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
Use HTTPS for secure communication if deployed on a real server.
Encrypt sensitive data like passwords before storing them in the database.

5. Code Organization
Extract repeated HTML (like headers and footers) into separate JSP files and include them using <jsp:include> for better reusability.

6. Validation
Add client-side validation using JavaScript for a better user experience, complementing the server-side validation.
Enhancements for Future
Add a Login System:

Validate user credentials against a database.
Restrict access to the profile page for unauthenticated users.
Pagination and List Display:

Show a list of registered users with pagination for admin functionality.
REST APIs:

Extend the project to support RESTful APIs for user registration and profile retrieval.
Frontend Enhancements:

Improve UI/UX with more advanced Bootstrap features.
Add feedback (e.g., modals, alerts) for better interaction.
